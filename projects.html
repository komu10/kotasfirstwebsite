                        Redesigned the surface (control) station, which is a 
                        a collection of equipment organized into a box
                        for portability that is used control the ROV. Originally, the 
                        surface station had a keyboard holder which meant there was a 
                        indent in the middle of the main platform. The router was also mounted
                        onto the indented keyboard holder, which resulted in the ends of the nails
                        sticking out of the wood and being a safety hazard. I proposed and made changes
                        to the station such that it now has a flat surface to work on, with the router 
                        and many other devices mounted to the bottom of the case using velcro for safety.

                        Generated manipulator ideas to complete a specific task in 
                        the 2022 MATE competition. This task involved retireving a 
                        liquid sample, thus a manipulator that can move the piston of
                        a syringe up and down to retrieve liquid was needed. I made a 
                        prototype for a manipulator that could achieve this mission.
                        I was not able to finish prototyping before the competition, but 
                        this was a great way to learn how to apply my CAD knowledge.

                        Modular Buoyancy Device

                    <p2>
                        Generated ideas for a modular ballasting system for the ROV.
                        The ROV is a underwater robot. Since we use it in salt water pools
                        to test and fresh water for the competition, we needed a modular
                        ballastying system to quickly change between different density test fluids.
                        My ideas were based on creating a modular weight attatchment in which
                        we could easily add or remove weights to adjust buoyancy by simply "clicking in"
                        an attatchment. My ideas were not selected in the final decision process, 
                        but seeing other people's ideas helped me learn more about underwater robotics
                        and this project was a great experience overall.

                        A trace of Iron Man using the adobe illustrator software. This was
