                Overview
            </h2>
            <p1 style="text-align:center">
                My name is Kota Murakami and I am a sophomore at
                the University of Washington studying Industial and
                Systems Engineering. I was spent the first 16
                years of my life in Issaquah, Washington. In the summer of 2020, my family moved to
                Tokyo, Japan, where I spent the final two years of high school
                at the American School in Japan before coming back to the USA for
                college. In terms of academic interests, I am interested in data analysis, 
                as I believe numbers can uncover ideas and understandings that
                could be difficult to find in other ways. Also, with statistics 
                being thrown around in advertisements, political campaigns, and 
                other real world situations, knowing where the numbers originate and
                having knowledge how to interpret those numbers could help in 
                developing a deeper understanding of complex concepts.

                Outside of School
            </h2>
            <p2 style="text-align:center">
                Outside of school, I enjoy watching soccer (I support Manchester United) and playing games such as 
                Fifa and Genshin Impact. I have also participated in soccer and karate
                in the past, although I have taken some time off of those activities since
                I moved to Japan. Also, I have had more opportunities to travel. In the winter
                of 2022, I was able to explore the national parks in the southwest, visiting
                the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Zion national park, and more. In the summer of 2023,
                I visited Kyoto and Osaka where I was able to try "temari sushi" which is 
                small bite sized sushi and visit Universal Studios Osaka. I did not expect 
                to travel as much as I have since entering college but I have enjoyed it 
                and I hope to get more chances to travel around the world.
